# OSU Classes + Rate My Professor
An extension for Firefox and Chrome (WIP). Create an issue for any feature requests and bugs.

## Description
Find out the ratings of professors at Oregon State University, without having to switch tabs or copy names. 
Ratings aren't everything*, but use your best judgement.

<sup><sub>*I've never heard this from professors with good ratings</sub></sup>

## Features
- Adds rating under the "Instructor" section in the details after clicking on a class
- Adds number of ratings also in that place
- Adds clicking on instructor name to link directly to RateMyProfessor page for more details

## How To Use
Works automatically. Just navigate to [classes.oregonstate.edu](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/) with the extension installed.

## Performance
I haven't tested the performance impact, but it shouldn't be much.
