Find out the ratings of professors at Oregon State University, without having to switch tabs or copy names. 
Ratings aren't everything*, but use your best judgement.

- Adds rating under the "Instructor" section in the details after clicking on a class
- Adds number of ratings also in that place
- Adds clicking on instructor name to link directly to RateMyProfessor page for more details

Works automatically. Just navigate to [classes.oregonstate.edu](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/) with the extension installed.

## Performance
I haven't tested the performance impact, but it shouldn't be much.
